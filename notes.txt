1. I made a testing script called test.sh which contains basic size checks for the input of the function. I can add more tests to this script later on.
- The make file sets the permissions to the test script then runs it using make check

2. I then split the functions in randall.c into separate files, where each .c file had an associated header file. I then added the header files includes into randall.c
- Moved the number of bytes checker into options.c
- Moved all hardware functions were placed into rand64-hw.c, including cpuid and hardware functions for rand64
