1. I first made the make checks test in the makefile, where I would allow the user to enter the number of bytes of random output, then checked to see if the bytes generated matched the number specified

2. I then split the functions in randall.c into separate files, where each .c file had an associated header file. I then added the header files includes into randall.c
- Moved the number of bytes checker into options.c
